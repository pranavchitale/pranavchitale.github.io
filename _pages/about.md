I am a second year M.S. Thesis student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, advised by [Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/). I have also been fortunate to work with [Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/) and [H. Andrew Schwartz](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/).

Presently, I am applying to Ph.D. programs with an interest in building personalizable <b>Human-centered Large Language Models</b> that can generate behaviorally-accurate responses or actions by capturing short term states and long term behavioral traits.

Previously, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://spit.ac.in/">Sardar Patel Institute of Technology</a> and joined JPMorganChase as a Software Engineer.
