I am a second year M.S. (by Thesis) student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, advised by [Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/). I have also been fortunate to work with [Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/) and [H. Andrew Schwartz](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/).

Presently, I am applying to Ph.D. programs and am broadly interested in leverging <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> for <b>Human-centered Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>.

Prior to Masters, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Engineering at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology and joined JPMorganChase as part of the Software Engineer Program (SEP).
